# Writing an issue
When you're writing an issue/feature request, make sure you're being concise and clear. Give what you want to see on the UI end, and if necessary the backend. Give a rough flow for how you want to see it implemented.

# How to run
First of all, you'll need to install Python 3, and if applicable pip(3). Most package managers have this as "python3" and "pip-python3" or something like that. On Windows I'd suggest installing chocolately and simply running "choco install python3". Trust me, it's the only way  I was able to use M$ Windows for debugging for as long as I did. If you're on Windows you'll need to add Python to your path if it hadn't been already. Alternatively you can simply invoke Python from its install directory.

Next, you'll need to download/clone the repository. You can click the big green download button. Alternatively if you want a much quicker and easier way, clone the repository using git. "choco install git" or go to git's website. 

After that, create a discord.token file. This should be on a single line. Stick it in the same directory as vally.py

Cool, now either run "python vally.py" or "python3 vally.py" depending on your setup.

# Contributing
Wowzers! You're one of the none of peope who wants to contribute! Congratulations! Just kidding, you're probably some human from the future maintaining this pile of garbage after I did a bunch of heroine and died -- like a true superstar. If I do happen to be alive, please do the following for when I get back.

When making any large internal changes, make an issue. Small bug fixes, adjustments, etc. are welcome to just be made via pull request. Your fork MUST BE PRIVATE! 

Be a bro and tag your stuff. Something that's urgent should probably be tagged as such, and I don't want to accidentailly add a NSFW channel maker into the bot when you could have marked the issue as "needing approval".

Be clean!!! The dev branch isn't for being messy -- it's for being edgy. Just like yours truly. And do I look messy bitch?
