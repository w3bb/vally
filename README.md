<p align="center">A bot designed originally for a shitty Discord server.</p>

<h3 align="center">About</h3>
<p align="center">This is the original source code for the SSD bot. It is licensed under the WTFPL. You can read it in the LICENSE file. This is old, outdated, and messy code. I was put under a time limit by Misanu, so I rushed to get things together. Feel free to use this shiity code for whatever you want! I don't care, this specifc version in this branch is free to use for whatever the fuck you want.</p>
