# Writing an issue
When you're writing an issue/feature request, make sure you're being concise and clear. Give what you want to see on the UI end, and if necessary the backend. Give a rough flow for how you want to see it implemented. If it's a bug report concisely explain what happens, and a method to reproduce it. **IF IT'S A MAJOR BUG THAT AFFECTS USER SECURITY, OR SERVER SECURITY PLEASE DM ME ON DISCORD!**
