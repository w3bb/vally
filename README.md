# Writing an issue
When you're writing an issue/feature request, make sure you're being concise and clear. Give what you want to see on the UI end, and if necessary the backend. Give a rough flow for how you want to see it implemented.

# Contributing
Wowzers! You're one of the none of peope who wants to contribute! Congratulations! Just kidding, you're probably some human from the future maintaining this pile of garbage after I did a bunch of heroine and died -- like a true superstar. If I do happen to be alive, please do the following for when I get back.

When making any large internal changes, make an issue. Small bug fixes, adjustments, etc. are welcome to just be made via pull request. Your fork MUST BE PRIVATE! 

Be a bro and tag your stuff. Something that's urgent should probably be tagged as such, and I don't want to accidentailly add a NSFW channel maker into the bot when you could have marked the issue as "needing approval".

Be clean!!! The dev branch isn't for being messy -- it's for being edgy. Just like yours truly. And do I look messy bitch?
